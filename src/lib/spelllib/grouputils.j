library GroupUtils
//******************************************************************************
//* BY: Rising_Dusk
//* 
//* This library is a simple implementation of a stack for groups that need to
//* be in the user's control for greater than an instant of time. Additionally,
//* this library provides a single, global group variable for use with user-end
//* enumerations. It is important to note that users should not be calling
//* DestroyGroup() on the global group, since then it may not exist for when it
//* it is next needed.
//*
//* The group stack removes the need for destroying groups and replaces it with
//* a recycling method.
//*     function NewGroup takes nothing returns group
//*     function ReleaseGroup takes group g returns boolean
//*     function GroupRefresh takes group g returns nothing
//* 
//* NewGroup grabs a currently unused group from the stack or creates one if the
//* stack is empty. You can use this group however you'd like, but always
//* remember to call ReleaseGroup on it when you are done with it. If you don't
//* release it, it will 'leak' and your stack may eventually overflow if you
//* keep doing that.
//* 
//* GroupRefresh cleans a group of any shadow references which may be clogging
//* its hash table. If you remove a unit from the game who is a member of a unit
//* group, it will 'effectively' remove the unit from the group, but leave a
//* shadow in its place. Calling GroupRefresh on a group will clean up any
//* shadow references that may exist within it.
